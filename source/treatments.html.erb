    <h1>Your treatment</h1>
      <p>Your first session will start with a short consultation about your health, lifestyle and general wellbeing. Then, while you relax on the couch in the beautiful practice room, there will be opportunity to talk and ask questions. During your treatment, you will be carefully assessed and monitored to ensure that you receive maximum benefits.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, you will be offered a reviving tea infusion. You will also be able to discuss how to prolong and support the beneficial effects of your treatment.</p>
